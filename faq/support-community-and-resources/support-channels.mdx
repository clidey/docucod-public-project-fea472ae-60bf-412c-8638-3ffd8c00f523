## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I get official support for GoogleTest and GoogleMock?

GoogleTest is an open-source project supported primarily through community channels and issue trackers. For official help:

- Use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/google/googletest/issues) to report bugs or request features.
- Review existing issues to see if your problem has already been addressed.
- Engage with the community on mailing lists or discussion forums (links located through the GitHub repository README).

### Where can I report bugs or unexpected behaviors?

Bugs and unexpected behaviors should be reported via the **GitHub Issues page** of the GoogleTest repository:

- Provide a clear description of the problem.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue, preferably with minimal code examples.
- Specify your environment, including platform, compiler version, and GoogleTest version.

This aids maintainers and contributors in diagnosing and resolving issues rapidly.

### How should I file an effective bug report?

To make your bug report actionable and effective:

1. **Describe the problem clearly and concisely.** What did you expect, and what happened?
2. **Provide minimal reproducible code.** A small test case that fails consistently is invaluable.
3. **Include environment details.** Platforms (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS), compilers (e.g., GCC 10.2, MSVC 2019), and the GoogleTest version (commit SHA or release number).
4. **Show test invocation commands and relevant output.** This could include compiler commands, test runner flags, and failure logs.
5. **Avoid including irrelevant details or large code dumps.** Keep it focused on the problem.

### What are the recommended ways to get help for troubleshooting?

- **Documentation:** Many common problems and their solutions are covered in other FAQ and Troubleshooting pages, such as "Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues" and "Diagnosing Test Failures".
- **Existing Issues:** Search the GitHub issues; often, other users have encountered similar problems.
- **Community Discussions:** Engage with the GoogleTest user community via mailing lists or forums for peer assistance.

### How can I contribute or get involved with the GoogleTest project?

You can contribute by:

- Reporting bugs politely and constructively.
- Submitting pull requests with fixes or enhancements.
- Improving documentation or tests.

Please review the contribution guidelines provided in the repository README.

### What is the best way to escalate issues if I donâ€™t get a timely response?

Given that GoogleTest is community-driven, escalation paths are limited. If your issue is urgent and unaddressed:

- Comment politely on your existing issue to request attention.
- Engage with the community and tag specific maintainers if appropriate.
- Consider seeking help from developer communities outside the project, like Stack Overflow.

## Example: Reporting a Bug Effectively

```
Title: GoogleMock fails to match overload when using MOCK_METHOD

Description:
When mocking overloaded methods using MOCK_METHOD, I experience
unexpected match failures.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Define a class with overloaded virtual methods.
2. Define a mock class using MOCK_METHOD for each overload.
3. Set EXPECT_CALL on one overload.
4. Call the method in test and observe failure.

Environment:
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Compiler: GCC 11.2
- GoogleTest version: main branch @ 9f8a7c

Test Command:
$ bazel test //my_test:mock_test

Expected:
Test passes, mock methods matched correctly.

Actual:
Match failure reported.

```

This level of detail allows maintainers to quickly understand and address issues.
