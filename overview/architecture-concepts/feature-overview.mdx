# Features at a Glance

Explore a concise summary of GoogleTest’s essential capabilities that empower developers to write expressive, maintainable, and scalable C++ tests. This overview is perfect for quick orientation or comparing GoogleTest's features with other frameworks.

## Comprehensive Assertion Types

GoogleTest offers a rich set of assertion macros that help verify conditions, equality, inequality, exceptions, and more. Each assertion comes in two variants:

- `EXPECT_*`: reports failures but allows the test to continue
- `ASSERT_*`: reports failures and aborts the current test function immediately

This design lets you control the granularity of your test validations and failure handling.

**Example:**

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual_value, expected_value) << "Mismatch at index " << i;
ASSERT_TRUE(pointer != nullptr) << "Pointer should not be null";
```

*For extensive details on assertions, see the [Assertions Reference](../reference/assertions.md)*.

---

## Automatic Test Discovery and Execution

GoogleTest automatically discovers all tests defined using macros such as `TEST()`, `TEST_F()`, `TEST_P()`, and runs them with no extra registration required. You can:

- Organize tests into suites that logically group related functionality
- Leverage test fixtures (`TEST_F`) to share common setup/teardown code
- Use parameterized tests (`TEST_P`) for testing multiple inputs with shared logic

**Example:**

```cpp
TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
  EXPECT_EQ(Add(2, 2), 4);
}

class QueueTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  void SetUp() override { /* common setup */ }
};

TEST_F(QueueTest, EnqueueDequeue) {
  Queue<int> q;
  q.Enqueue(5);
  EXPECT_EQ(q.Dequeue(), 5);
}
```

---

## User-Defined Assertions and Custom Matchers

GoogleTest enables the creation of expressive, reusable custom assertions and matchers for complex testing scenarios:

- **Custom Assertions**: Define predicate functions that return `testing::AssertionResult` to provide richer failure messages.
- **Matchers**: Use built-in or write custom matchers with `EXPECT_THAT()` to make assertions that read like natural language.

**Example:**

```cpp
// Custom predicate
testing::AssertionResult IsEven(int n) {
  if (n % 2 == 0) return testing::AssertionSuccess();
  return testing::AssertionFailure() << n << " is odd";
}

TEST(NumberTest, CheckEven) {
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, 4);  // passes
  EXPECT_PRED1(IsEven, 5);  // fails with message
}

// Using built-in matcher
EXPECT_THAT(my_string, ::testing::StartsWith("Hello"));
```

## Parameterized and Typed Testing

Scale your tests efficiently with GoogleTest's powerful parameterization support:

- **Value-Parameterized Tests (`TEST_P`)**: Write a single test logic run against multiple data values.
- **Typed Tests (`TYPED_TEST`)** and **Type-Parameterized Tests (`TYPED_TEST_P`)**: Run the same test logic across various types, ensuring interface compliance and broad coverage.

**Example:**

```cpp
class MyTestSuite : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(MyTestSuite, IsPositive) {
  EXPECT_GT(GetParam(), 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    PositiveNumbers, MyTestSuite,
    testing::Values(1, 2, 3, 10));

// Typed test example
template <typename T>
class FooTest : public testing::Test {};

TYPED_TEST_SUITE(FooTest, ::testing::Types<int, double>);

TYPED_TEST(FooTest, DefaultConstructible) {
  TypeParam value{};  // test default-constructibility
  (void)value;
}
```

*See the [Advanced Guide](../advanced.md#value-parameterized-tests) and [Typed Tests](../advanced.md#typed-tests) for deeper understanding.*

## Robust Mocking Integration

GoogleTest integrates seamlessly with GoogleMock, allowing you to create mocks for complex dependencies and verify interactions:

- Define mock classes and methods
- Set expectations on calls
- Control call behaviors
- Manage mock strictness (Nice, Naggy, and Strict mocks)

This powerful mocking framework simplifies testing of complex or external interfaces.

*For detailed guidance, refer to the [Mocking Guides](../guides/mocking-patterns/creating-mocks.md) and [API Reference: GoogleMock Mocking APIs](../api-reference/googlemock-mocking-apis/mock-class-definition.md)*.

---

## Extended Reporting and Test Metadata

GoogleTest provides detailed and accessible output:

- Color-coded terminal output for easy scanning
- XML and JSON reporting for CI pipelines
- Support for recording test properties (`RecordProperty()`) for flexible metadata tagging

This helps teams automate testing, gather analytics, and understand test outcomes quickly.

**Tip:** Redirect logs and separate GoogleTest outputs using shell redirection to improve readability.

---

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Avoid underscores in test and test suite names:** to prevent naming conflicts or reserved naming usage.
- **Use test fixtures for shared resource management:** ensure isolation and reduce flakiness.
- **Choose assertions wisely:** use `ASSERT_*` to abort early when continuation is meaningless.
- **Leverage parameterized testing:** reduce code duplication and enhance coverage.
- **Use `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` return value:** Reflect test success or failure correctly in your `main()`.

Feel empowered to navigate GoogleTest’s capabilities confidently and efficiently to write robust tests that scale with your project’s complexity.
