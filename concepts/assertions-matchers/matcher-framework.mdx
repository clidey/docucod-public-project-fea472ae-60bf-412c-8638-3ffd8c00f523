# Matcher System and Extensibility

GoogleTest and GoogleMock provide an expressive, flexible matcher system that empowers you to write precise, readable tests. This guide delves into the core concepts of matchers—the building blocks of test expressions—including built-in, polymorphic, and user-defined matchers. You will learn how matchers operate, how to chain and combine them to describe complex argument constraints, and how to create custom matchers to suit your needs.

## What Are Matchers?

Matchers in GoogleTest and GoogleMock act as predicates that verify whether function arguments, values, or objects meet certain conditions. Unlike simple equality checks, matchers provide rich, intention-revealing descriptions of expected test conditions, leading to clearer, more maintainable tests.

Examples of matchers include:

- Wildcard matcher `_` that matches any value.
- Comparison matchers like `Eq()`, `Ge()`, `Lt()`, which match values equal to, greater-or-equal, or less than a specified value.
- Container matchers like `ElementsAre()`, `Contains()` that match sequences or collections.
- String matchers such as `StartsWith()`, `HasSubstr()`, and regex matchers.

Matchers are most often used with GoogleMock’s `EXPECT_CALL` to specify argument expectations and with `EXPECT_THAT` assertions to verify values.

## Built-in Matchers and How to Use Them

GoogleMock comes bundled with a comprehensive set of built-in matchers that cover common use cases. Here are key categories:

- **Polymorphic Matchers**: Can be used with values of many types without type conflicts. For example, `Eq(5)` can match any numeric type equal to 5.
- **Comparison Matchers**: `Eq()`, `Ne()`, `Lt()`, `Le()`, `Gt()`, and `Ge()` test for standard comparisons.
- **Container Matchers**: `ElementsAre()`, `UnorderedElementsAre()`, `Contains()`, `Each()`, `SizeIs()` allow fine-grained matching of container contents.
- **String Matchers**: `StrEq()`, `StrNe()`, `StrCaseEq()`, `StartsWith()`, `EndsWith()`, `HasSubstr()`, `MatchesRegex()`, and `ContainsRegex()` work both on C strings and string objects.
- **Pointer Matchers**: `IsNull()`, `NotNull()`, `Pointee()`, `Pointer()` validate pointers and the values they point to.

### Example Usage

```cpp
using ::testing::_;
using ::testing::Eq;
using ::testing::Ge;
using ::testing::StartsWith;
using ::testing::ElementsAre;

EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(Eq(5), _));         // Matches first argument == 5, second is anything.
EXPECT_THAT(container, ElementsAre(1, Ge(2), _)); // Container with first element 1, second >= 2, third anything
EXPECT_THAT(str, StartsWith("Hello"));            // String starts with "Hello"
```

## Polymorphic Matchers

Polymorphic matchers are essentially matcher factories which can adapt themselves to the type of the value being tested. This allows you to write once and use across different types seamlessly.

For example, `NotNull()` is a polymorphic matcher that works on any pointer type, verifying it is non-null.

```cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Bar(NotNull()));
```

Behind the scenes, matchers implement templated `MatchAndExplain` methods to accept a broad range of argument types.

## Creating Custom Matchers

If built-in matchers don’t cover your needs, GoogleMock offers intuitive macros to create custom matchers quickly without deep knowledge of internals.

### Using MATCHER and MATCHER_P macros

- `MATCHER(name, description_string) { ... }` creates a parameterless matcher called `name`.
- `MATCHER_P(name, param, description_string) { ... }` creates a matcher with one parameter.

Inside the matcher body, use:

- `arg` to refer to the value being matched.
- `result_listener` to output additional diagnostic explanation on match failure or success.

Example:

```cpp
MATCHER(IsDivisibleBy7, "") {
  if ((arg % 7) != 0) {
    *result_listener << "the remainder is " << (arg % 7);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

// Usage
EXPECT_CALL(mock, Foo(IsDivisibleBy7()));
EXPECT_THAT(value, IsDivisibleBy7());
```

### Writing Polymorphic Custom Matchers

For advanced users needing control, implement a class with:

- Template `MatchAndExplain(const T& value, MatchResultListener* listener) const`
- `DescribeTo(std::ostream* os)` and `DescribeNegationTo(std::ostream* os)` methods

Wrap with `MakePolymorphicMatcher()` to create a polymorphic matcher.

### Advanced Matcher Patterns

GoogleMock supports:

- **Matcher chaining and combining:** Using combinators like `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()` to build complex logic.
- **Multi-argument matchers:** The `.With()` clause and `Args<>` matcher to validate multiple parameters as a tuple.
- **Container and field/property matching:** `Field()`, `Property()` to assert complex object properties.

## Matcher Casts and Conversions

To maintain type safety while allowing flexibility, GoogleMock provides:

- `SafeMatcherCast<T>(m)`: Safely casts matcher `m` to operate on values of type `T`. This enforces certain type constraints at compile time.
- `MatcherCast<T>(m)`: Looser cast that allows static casts; should be used carefully.

This facilitates using matchers designed for broader types on more specific argument types or vice versa.

## Matcher Interface and Lifecycle

Matchers are immutable, copyable objects internally holding implementations with polymorphic `MatchAndExplain` behavior. When a test executes, GoogleMock uses `MatchAndExplain` to check if a value meets the criteria and to optionally generate detailed explanations for failures.

The interface methods are:

- `bool MatchAndExplain(const T& value, MatchResultListener* listener) const`
- `void DescribeTo(std::ostream* os) const`
- `void DescribeNegationTo(std::ostream* os) const`

Matchers also support composing explanations that clarify why a particular argument failed or passed, greatly enhancing the debuggability of failed assertions.

## Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Use matchers to clearly express intent rather than manually coding checks.
- Combine simple matchers using `AllOf()`, `AnyOf()`, and `Not()` for complex conditions.
- Use `Field()` and `Property()` to focus on important object members rather than entire objects.
- Create custom matchers using `MATCHER` macros for reusable and expressive domain-specific conditions.
- Use `SafeMatcherCast` when types are compatible but not exactly matching.
- Keep custom matchers pure and free of side effects to ensure consistent test behavior.

## Common Pitfalls

- Avoid mixing expectations and mock method calls out of order. Set expectations before exercising the code.
- Be cautious when creating loose expectations; over-specification can make tests brittle.
- Remember that `Return()` with move-only types only works once; use lambdas to provide fresh objects each time.
- When matching pointers with `Pointee()`, `NULL` always fails to match; use `IsNull()` for pointer nullity.

## Summary

Matchers are central to writing effective, readable GoogleTest and GoogleMock tests. They allow declarative, expressive validation of values and mock arguments with detailed diagnostic messages. GoogleMock’s matcher system offers a rich set of built-in matchers, polymorphism for flexible reusable matchers, composability for complex criteria, and easy extensibility via macros or class-based matchers.

With these tools, you can write precise expectations, handle complex data structures, and express domain-specific logic cleanly while gaining diagnostic clarity during test failures.
