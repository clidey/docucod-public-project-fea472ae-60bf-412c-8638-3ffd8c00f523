# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page outlines the foundational compiler, language standard, and platform requirements necessary to successfully install and run **GoogleTest** and **GoogleMock**. Ensuring your system meets these prerequisites is critical for a smooth setup and reliable testing experience.

---

## 1. C++ Language Standard

- **Minimum Required Standard:** C++17 (ISO/IEC 14882:2017) or later.
- GoogleTest version 1.17.0 and newer require at least C++17 support in your compiler.

<Tip>
Make sure your compiler is set to use C++17 or later by specifying the appropriate compiler flags, such as `-std=c++17` for GCC and Clang or `/std:c++17` for MSVC.
</Tip>

## 2. Supported Compilers

GoogleTest supports a variety of modern C++ compilers that fully implement C++17 or newer. Confirm your compiler version and compatibility:

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection): Version supporting C++17 (e.g., GCC 7+).
- **Clang/LLVM:** Version supporting C++17.
- **Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC):** Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 or later.
- Other compilers are supported as per Google's foundational C++ support policy.

See the [Supported Platforms & Requirements](../overview/getting-started-integration/supported-platforms.md) page for detailed compiler version matrices.

## 3. Supported Platforms

GoogleTest is cross-platform and runs on most major operating systems with C++17-capable toolchains:

- **Linux** distributions
- **macOS** (including iOS for test code compatibility)
- **Windows** desktop and MinGW

The foundational C++ support policy defines platforms and build tools compatible with GoogleTest, accessible here:

- [Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support)
- [Supported compiler and platform matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

## 4. Build Tool Requirements

- Use build systems compatible with C++17 and your chosen platform.
- GoogleTest includes CMake support; CMake version 3.14 or newer is required for using the `FetchContent` module.
- Compatible generators for CMake include Make, Ninja, Visual Studio, and Xcode.

<Tip>
If you plan to integrate GoogleTest into your existing project, confirm your build system supports adding dependencies on external projects or downloading source code during configuration.
</Tip>

## 5. System Environment

- Ensure your system has sufficient memory and disk space to clone the GoogleTest repository and build the binaries.
- For Windows, be aware of runtime linkage and the `gtest_force_shared_crt` flag, which controls whether the C runtime is linked dynamically or statically. Align this setting with your project to avoid linker errors.

## 6. Other Considerations

- **Thread Safety:** GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthread support.
- **File System:** A file system must be available for some GoogleTest features (e.g., death tests).

## 7. Verifying Your Environment

To verify your environment meets these requirements:

1. Check your compiler version:
   ```bash
   gcc --version          # For GCC
   clang --version        # For Clang
   cl /?                  # For MSVC
   ```
2. Confirm C++17 support by compiling a simple test program with C++17 flags.
3. Ensure CMake version is sufficient:
   ```bash
   cmake --version
   ```
4. Reference the supported platform matrix linked above for platform-specific constraints.

## 8. Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Compiler Does Not Support C++17">
Verify the compiler version. Update to a newer compiler release.
If unable to upgrade, you cannot use GoogleTest version 1.17.0 or later.

Workaround: Use older GoogleTest versions compatible with your compiler, but note these may lack recent features and fixes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Build Tool Version Too Low">
Upgrade CMake to 3.14 or higher.
Older versions do not support `FetchContent`, which is used by GoogleTest for integration.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linker Errors on Windows Related to Runtime Libraries">
Set the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to ON if your project uses dynamic C runtime linkage.

Example:
```cmake
set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
